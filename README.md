# sync_robo
Script to replicate your files. Only the modified files are copied thanks to robocopy. 

This script replicates folders from a source (left) to a destination (right).
You can select the subfolders you want to replicate in a file named "sync_robo_list.txt", one subfolder per line. 
The files different from the left side are overwritten on the right side. 
Deletes are replicated from the left side to the right side. 
So be careful !

WARNING !
We do not guarantee any possible DATA LOSS. Use this script with attention. Thank you. 
We recommend you to test the script on sample folders first.
